## Sources

The background map is from the Stranger Things companion book, _Stranger Things: Worlds Turned Upside Down: The Official Behind-The-Scenes Companion_. It's used by Hopper in season 2 to add decay markers after visiting the pumpkin patches. The markers are still visible on the map, around Hawkins National Laboratory.
In season 3, episode 4, Joyce and Jim look at an old map in Mayor Kline's house; this map and the dialogue is inconsistent with the one used here.

> Hess Farm, Henry's place, Bullocks. Look, they're all here. They're all in Southeast Hawkins, right near Jordan Lake [and] the power plant.

On our map, Jordan Lake is not in Southeast Hawkins, and it's nowhere near Starcourt Mall, which is supposed to be built on or around Hess Farm.

## Inconsistencies

- Benny's Burgers is at 4819 Randolph Lane but Murray's map places it somewhere on Randolph Way
- The Wheelers and Sinclairs live on Maple Street but the map only has a Maple Avenue
- Mrs Driscoll lives at 4819 Cornwallis Road but the map only has a Cornwallis Way
