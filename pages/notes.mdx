## Sources

The Hawkins map is from the Stranger Things companion book, _Stranger Things: Worlds Turned Upside Down: The Official Behind-The-Scenes Companion_. It’s used by Hopper in season 2 to add decay markers after visiting the pumpkin patches. The markers are still visible on the map, around the <Tooltip imgSrc="/assets/hawkins-national-laboratory.jpg">Hawkins National Laboratory</Tooltip>.

The [Starcourt blueprints](/starcourt) are reproductions of designs from production designer Chris Trujillo ([Source](https://deadline.com/2020/06/stranger-things-production-designer-chris-trujillo-netflix-the-art-of-craft-interview-1202950693/)). Some of the place names have been updated to match the show.

## Inconsistencies

- ### Benny's Burgers
  
  <Tooltip imgSrc="/assets/bennys-burgers.jpg">Benny’s Burgers</Tooltip> is at 4819 Randolph Lane but Murray’s map places it somewhere on Randolph Way, so the map might not be correctly labelled

- ### Maple Street

  The Wheelers and Sinclairs live on Maple Street but the map only has a Maple Avenue. The Maple on the map crosses Dearborn, which fits with what we know from the show:

  > “Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00. To study.”
  >
  > <cite>Nancy to Steve, S1E1</cite>

  However, in S4E7, when Nancy, Robin, Eddie, and Robin go through the curse gate in <Tooltip imgSrc="/assets/lovers-lake.jpg">Lover’s Lake</Tooltip>, Nancy hints that her place is closer than the police station:

  > “We don’t have to go all the way downtown for guns. I have guns, in my bedroom.”
  >
  > <cite>Nancy, S4E7</cite>

  Later in the episode, the Fruity Four bike past the <Tooltip imgSrc="/assets/creel-house.jpg">Creel House</Tooltip>, so we can assume it’s between <Tooltip imgSrc="/assets/lovers-lake.jpg">Lover’s Lake</Tooltip> and the <Tooltip imgSrc="/assets/wheeler-house.jpg">Wheelers</Tooltip>. If the <Tooltip imgSrc="/assets/wheeler-house.jpg">Wheeler House</Tooltip> is indeed close to <Tooltip imgSrc="/assets/lovers-lake.jpg">Lover’s Lake</Tooltip>, this would mean that 3 of the curse gates would be in close proximity (<Tooltip imgSrc="/assets/creel-house.jpg">Creel House</Tooltip>, <Tooltip imgSrc="/assets/lovers-lake.jpg">Lover’s Lake</Tooltip>, the <Tooltip imgSrc="/assets/munson-trailer.jpg">Munson trailer</Tooltip>), despite the shot of the gates making it look like they come from opposing sides.

- ### Mayor Kline’s map
  
  In season 3, episode 4, Joyce and Jim look at an old map in Mayor Kline’s house; this map and the dialogue is inconsistent with the one used here.

  > “Hess Farm, Henry’s place, Bullocks. Look, they’re all here. They’re all in Southeast Hawkins, right near Jordan Lake. And what else is near Jordan Lake? The power plant.”
  >
  > <cite>Joyce and Hopper, S3E4</cite>

  On our map, Jordan Lake is not in Southeast Hawkins, and it’s nowhere near <Tooltip imgSrc="/assets/starcourt-mall.jpg">Starcourt Mall</Tooltip>, which is supposed to be built on or around Hess Farm. The map being reversed could be a reference to the Upside Down (’Jordan Lake’ also becomes ’Lake Jordan’), but that wouldn’t explain the fact that Starcourt Mall is now near Jordan Lake.

Based on the above, it seems like the writers didn’t intend for any map on the show to be an accurate representation of Hawkins, including the one used on this website.
